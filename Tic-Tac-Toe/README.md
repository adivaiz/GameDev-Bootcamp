# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (X-O)

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **Unity** and **C#** as part of a Game Development Bootcamp.  

## 📌 Game Description  
Tic Tac Toe is a classic 2-player game played on a 3x3 grid.  
Players take turns marking a square with either **X** or **O**.  
The goal is to be the first player to align three of their marks:  
- Horizontally  
- Vertically  
- Diagonally  

The game ends when a player wins or when all squares are filled (resulting in a **draw**).  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Interactive **3x3 grid** board.  
- **Turn management** between Player X and Player O.  
- Automatic **win detection** (rows, columns, diagonals).  
- **Game Over panel** with a winning or draw message.  
- **Restart button** to start a new match.  
- Choose the starting player (**X or O**).  
- Visual highlights with colors to indicate the active player.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Unity** (Game Engine)  
- **C#** (game logic and scripts)  
- **TextMeshPro** (UI text rendering)  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project  
- Practice building a full game loop with Unity.  
- Learn about game states, UI management, and turn-based logic.  
- Explore how to structure scripts and connect them with Unity components.
